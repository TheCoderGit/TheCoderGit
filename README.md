Hi, Iâ€™m Ahmed Salem

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Kotlin now a days.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced Kotlin programming

My Bio: After 20 years of trying to be a programmer or a developer , I decided to be a coder. I went through over a 150 online courses. The first programming language I have tried was "logo". In the last nineties. Then tried BASIC. and the first actual programing trials were in 2000. using visual basic 6.0 this was before the .Net. I spent two years trying this language as a hoppy. Then I was a way for about 5 years . Till I bought the first android mobile. then I tried to think about developing the android applications. tried to go back to programming , back to visual basic.. moving to C#. then a little C++. a few python. and finally in 2009, started to learn java. about two years then stopped again for two years , and finally started to find the way to be professional.
Went through a few online courses related to computer since , and the most amazing one was "CS50", by the professor Davide J. Malan. I was inspired by this course and started to move step by step to be a professional developer. till I met an amazing android development track. related to "1 MILLION ARAB CODERS INITIATIVE" initiated by HH "Mohammed Ben Rashid Al Maktoum". it was the real start to the world of professional programming.and may be this is why I chose "THE CODER" to by my nickname. then I build a few apps . then started to answer a lot of queries in the field of programming. from this point a lot of friends asked me to create a youtube channel, so I started to record a few videos and publish it in my new youtube channel. and still going forward to be more professional.
